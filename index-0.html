          I've made my home base in Providence, Rhode Island with my small growing family. My journey into tech started with a degree in journalism. As I started sharing my writing online, I was fascinated with how easily I could get my voice out there. I was hooked and wanted to learn how to build my own site to fit my own specific needs.

          That curiosity then opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom & versality I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.
